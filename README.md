# cpp-calculator

A console-based calculator implementing the **Shunting-yard algorithm** and **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**.
This project was created to understand how mathematical expressions are evaluated programmatically

My implementation supports operators **+, -, *, /, (), % and ^**. 

## Skills & Concepts:
### Computer Science:
*  **Shunting-yard algorithm**
*  **Reverse polish notation**
*  **Stack machine**
### C++ features:
* **std::stack**
* **concepts**
* **some functions from "algorithm" library**
* **std::string_view**

## Extra:
* **Language: C++20**
* **IDE: Visual Studio 2022**
